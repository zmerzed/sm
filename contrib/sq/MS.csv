Set Options,Rep Options ,Tempo ,Rest ,Repetition Pattern,Tempo Explained
1,1,20X1,15 sec,*rest-pause,"The First Number - Using the squat as an example, the 3 will represent the amount of time (in seconds) it takes you to descend to the bottom position. "
2,2,30X1,30 sec,**drop set,"The Second Number - The second number refers to the time spent in the bottom/transition between eccentric(lowering) and the concentric(ascending) portion of the exercise. The 0 means the trainee immediately begins their ascent after they reach the bottom postion. If the prescription were 32X0, the trainee would pause for 2 seconds at the bottom position."
3,3,40X1,45 sec,Cluster,"The Third Number - The third number refers to ascending (concentric) phase of the lift. The X  indicates that the trainee must EXPLODE at the initiation of the concentric action and try to accelerate the load throughout the entire range of motion. Intent is vital; the load may move slowly but you must try to move as fast as possible. If number is 2, it should take 2 seconds to complete the lift even if they are capable of moving it faster."
4,4,50X1,60 sec,Ascending Load*,"The Fourth Number – The fourth number indicates the pause at the moment before the start of the next repetition of the lift. For a 45 degree back extension with a tempo of 2012, the trainee will hold an isometric contraction in the extended position for two seconds before lowering."
5,5,21X0,75 sec,Constant Load*,*Ascending Load: Load is increased upon each successful set all while maintaining repetition range
6,6,31X0,90 sec,Descending Load*,"*Constant Load: load is slightly below your maximal performance for the prescribed repetitions, allows completition of all prescribed sets and reps"
7,2-4,41X0,120 sec,Pyramid Load,"*Descending Load: Initial load is at rep maximum, load is decrease after each set in order to maintain rep range"
8,3-5,51X0,150 sec,Wave Load,*Pyramid Load: load is increased and repetitions decreased with each successive set
