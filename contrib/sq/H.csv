1,6,2011,15 sec,*rest-pause,,"The First Number – Using the squat as an example, the 3 will represent the amount of time (in seconds) it takes you to descend to the bottom position. "
2,7,3011,30 sec,**drop set,,"The Second Number – The second number refers to the time spent in the bottom/transition between eccentric(lowering) and the concentric(ascending) portion of the exercise. The 0 means the trainee immediately begins their ascent after they reach the bottom postion. If the prescription were 32X0, the trainee would pause for 2 seconds at the bottom position."
3,8,4011,45 sec,Cluster,,"The Third Number – The third number refers to ascending (concentric) phase of the lift. The X  indicates that the trainee must EXPLODE at the initiation of the concentric action and try to accelerate the load throughout the entire range of motion. Intent is vital; the load may move slowly but you must try to move as fast as possible. If number is 2, it should take 2 seconds to complete the lift even if they are capable of moving it faster."
4,9,5011,60 sec,Ascending Load,,"The Fourth Number – The fourth number indicates the pause at the moment before the start of the next repetition of the lift. For a 45 degree back extension with a tempo of 2012, the trainee will hold an isometric contraction in the extended position for two seconds before lowering."
